Tyrannosaurus Rex - a massive carnivore with powerful legs and a distinctive head.\n2. Velociraptor - a small, feathered carnivore with sharp claws.\n3. Diplodocus - a long, herbivorous dinosaur with a small head and long tail.\n4. Stegosaurus - a plant-eating dinosaur with a row of plates on its back and spiked tail.\n5. Triceratops - a horned herbivore with a distinctive frill on its head.\n\nDinosaurs likely went extinct due to a combination of factors, including:\n\n1. Massive asteroid impact\n2. Volcanic eruptions\n3. Climate change\n4. Shifts in the Earth's geography\n\nSome interesting dinosaur facts:\n\n* The word \"dinosaur\" means \"terrible lizard\" in Greek.\n* Dinosaurs likely had feathers, not scales.\n* Some dinosaurs were as small as chickens, while others were over 100 feet long!\n* Dinosaurs had excellent eyesight and could see in color.\n\nWould you like to know more about a specific type of dinosaur or aspect of their world?"
