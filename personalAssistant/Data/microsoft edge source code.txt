I can provide you with some information about the Microsoft Edge source code. However, please note that the full source code of Microsoft Edge is not publicly available, as it is a proprietary software developed by Microsoft.

Microsoft Edge is built using a combination of open-source and proprietary components. The browser's rendering engine, called Microsoft EdgeHTML, is a proprietary component, and its source code is not publicly available.

However, Microsoft has made some components of Microsoft Edge open-source, including:

1. **Microsoft Edge's Chromium-based engine**: In 2019, Microsoft announced that it would be rebuilding Microsoft Edge using the Chromium open-source project, which is also used by Google Chrome. The Chromium-based engine is open-source, and its source code is available on the Chromium project's website.
2. **Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine**: Microsoft Edge's JavaScript engine, called Chakra, is open-source, and its source code is available on GitHub.
3. **Microsoft Edge's extensions**: Microsoft Edge's extensions are built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and their source code is available on the Microsoft Edge Extensions GitHub repository.

If you're interested in exploring the source code of Microsoft Edge's open-source components, you can visit the following repositories:

* Chromium project: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git
* Microsoft Edge's Chakra JavaScript engine: https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore
* Microsoft Edge Extensions: https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions

Keep in mind that the source code of Microsoft Edge's proprietary components, including the EdgeHTML rendering engine, is not publicly available.

Here is a sample code snippet in C++ that demonstrates how to use the Chromium-based engine to create a basic browser window:
```cpp
#include <chromium/base/base.h>
#include <chromium/browser/browser.h>
#include <chromium/browser/ui/browser_window.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  // Initialize Chromium
  chromium::base::Initialize();

  // Create a new browser window
  chromium::browser::Browser* browser = new chromium::browser::Browser();

  // Set the window title
  browser->window()->SetTitle("My Browser");

  // Set the window size
  browser->window()->SetSize(800, 600);

  // Show the window
  browser->window()->Show();

  // Run the browser event loop
  chromium::base::RunLoop run_loop;
  run_loop.Run();

  return 0;
}
```
Note that this code snippet is a simplified example and is not intended to be used in production. The actual source code of Microsoft Edge is much more complex and involves many more components and features.
