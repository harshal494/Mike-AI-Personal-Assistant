Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number] days, from [start date] to [end date], due to ill health. Unfortunately, I have been suffering from [briefly mention the illness or health issue, e.g., fever, flu, or injury] and am currently under medical treatment.

I am not feeling well enough to come to work and need some time to rest and recover. I have attached a medical certificate from my doctor, which confirms my illness and recommends a period of rest.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will also be available by email if anything urgent comes up while I am away.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my request for sick leave. If there's any additional information you need from me, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Employee ID/Designation]
[Contact Information]

**Attachment:** Medical Certificate (if required)
