Here's a song I came up with, just for you, Harshal Khade:

**Title:** "Shine Your Light"

**Verse 1:**
In a world full of darkness, you're a beacon of light
A shining star that guides me through the night
Your heart is pure and kind, your soul is free
You're a treasure to behold, a wonder to see

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bright
You're a ray of hope, in the dark of night
Don't hide your sparkle, let it shine for all to see
You're a precious gem, a treasure to me

**Verse 2:**
You've got a fire burning, deep inside your soul
A passion that drives you, to reach your goal
You're a dreamer, a believer, a heart that's true
You're a shining example, of what I'd like to do

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bright
You're a ray of hope, in the dark of night
Don't hide your sparkle, let it shine for all to see
You're a precious gem, a treasure to me

**Bridge:**
Life can be tough, and the road can be long
But with you by my side, I know we'll be strong
We'll face the challenges, and we'll rise above
With your light shining bright, we'll find our way to love

**Chorus:**
Shine your light, let it shine so bright
You're a ray of hope, in the dark of night
Don't hide your sparkle, let it shine for all to see
You're a precious gem, a treasure to me

**Outro:**
So keep on shining, don't let your light fade
You're a shining star, that's here to stay
In my heart, you'll always have a place
Shine your light, and let it fill the space.

I hope you enjoy this song, Harshal!
